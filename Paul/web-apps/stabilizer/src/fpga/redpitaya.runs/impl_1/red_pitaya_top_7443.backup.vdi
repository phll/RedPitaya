WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
Resolution: For a complete and accurate timing signoff, report_timing_summary must be run after route_design. Alternatively, route_design can be run with the -timing_summary option to enable a complete timing signoff at the end of route_design.

WARNING: [Route 35-426] Router was unable to fix hold violation on unroutable pins. The router cannot add routing detours to improve hold time because the pins are part of one or more of the following unroutable types: partition pins, fixed routes and intra-site connections.
Resolution: Run report_timing_summary to analyze the hold violations.
