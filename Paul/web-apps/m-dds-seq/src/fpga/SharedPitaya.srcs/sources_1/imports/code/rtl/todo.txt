TRY CODE WHERE THE CHANNELS SWEEP!
WRITE CODE THAT CAN GENERATE DATA FOR MANY CHANNELS AT ONCE!
PUT # OF CHANNELS INTO THE CODE
BE SURE TO SEND SOMETHING TO EVERY CHANNEL! (to clear out the unused ones!)

DEAL WITH GOING OVER THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED VALUE FOR OUTPUT!! HAVE IT SATURATE RATHER THAN OVERFLOW!! ONLY COSTS AN EXTRA CYCLE OR TWO AT THE END!

SPEED UP THE SENDING CODE
USE MACS intelligently (ADD AND MULTIPLY!)
SEE HOW MANY CHANNELS WE CAN USE
MORE BITS/ENTRIES for the DDS SINE TABLES!


add amplitude to python code, fully
HOW MANY BITS DO WE NEED FOR AMPLTIUDE, IF IT MUST RAMP ON EACH STEP?!
implement amplitude SWEEP rather than jump, and put in the appropriate prescalars at the end, and do the MAC all at once!
have prescalars and stuff in variables!
bring box to work to test with spectrum analyzer! the only way to see all freqs move nicely, at once!!
FIX THE DATA THAT IS NO LONGER VALID -- BRAM UPDATES ON NEXT CLOCK CYCLE SO STORE INTERVAL VALUE AS WELL!
speed up code/data sending!


HAVE THE WHOLE THING USE ONE OF THE OUTPUTS (A OR B)
IMPLEMENT A SECOND COPY, IN A SECOND REGION OF RAM, FOR THE OTHER OUTPUT!   

decoding for software/hardware trigger goes in outer DDS controller code, and is fed in
decoding for DDS_reset goes in outer DDS controller code, and is fed in
decoding for DDS data gets done channel-by-channel
