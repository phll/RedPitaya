BEST TO USE WIRED INTERNET FOR THE COMPUTER TOO! Use the TP-Link router, whose WIFI IS DISABLED! EXCELLENT!
FIRST TURN ON ROUTER (NO OUTSIDE NETWORK CONNECTIVITY NECESSARY)
WITH RP AND COMPUTER PLUGGED INTO ROUTER, TURN BOTH ON

RP's IP (for ...1B:B9 MAC) is 192.168.0.42, for the tp-link router! STATIC!

TO FIND IP ADDRESS:
connect usb cable from computer to OTHER USB port
ls /dev/cu.*
screen /dev/cu.usbserial-DQ004ZSQ 115200 8N1

cd "/Users/jon/Dropbox/Faculty Stuff/RedPitaya/NewDDS_MultiChromatic/SharedPitaya.runs/impl_1"
scp red_pitaya_top.bit root@192.168.1.100:~
passwd: root

ssh root@192.168.1.100
passwd:root
cat red_pitaya_top.bit > /dev/xdevcfg

THEN RUN "python DDSMulti_Sequencer.py RP_IP=192.168.0.42" ON THE LOCAL MACHINE
YOU CAN MODIFY THE BOTTOM OF THIS PROGRAM TO CHANGE THE SEQUENCE THAT GETS BUILT AND SENT!
